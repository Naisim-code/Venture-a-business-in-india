Ideas, creativity, and execution are essential for a start-up to flourish. But are they enough? Investors provide start-ups and other entrepreneurial ventures with the capital---popularly known as "funding"---to think big, grow rich, and leave a lasting impact. In this project, you are going to analyse funding received by start-ups in India from 2018 to 2021. You will find the data for each year of funding in a separate csv file in the dataset provided. In these files you'll find the start-ups' details, the funding amounts received, and the investors' information.
